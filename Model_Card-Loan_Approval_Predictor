# Model Card — Loan Approval Predictor

## 1. Overview
- Model Name: Loan Approval Predictor
- Version: 1.2.3
- Owner / Team: Credit Risk Analytics Team
- Primary Use Case: Predict whether a loan application should be approved
- Intended Users: Loan officers, credit risk analysts
- Business Goal / Purpose: Reduce default risk while ensuring fair and consistent approvals

## 2. Model Description
- Model Type: Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
- Input Data: Applicant income, credit history, age, employment status, ZIP code
- Output: Loan approval probability (0–1)
- Training Date / Timeframe: Jan 2025 – June 2025
- Pipeline Location / Repo: GitHub/LoanApprovalModel/Prod

## 3. Data Summary
### 3.1 Data Sources
- Internal bank loan applications (last 5 years)
- Credit bureau data
- Collection method: transactional data, consent collected
- Sampling strategy: stratified sampling across income bands

### 3.2 Data Characteristics
- Number of records: 150,000
- Feature types: numeric (income, credit score), categorical (employment, ZIP code)
- Protected attributes: Gender, Age
- Preprocessing steps: missing value imputation, one-hot encoding, feature scaling

## 4. Performance Evaluation
### 4.1 Overall Metrics
- Accuracy: 0.91
- AUC: 0.94
- Precision: 0.89
- Recall: 0.92
- Calibration: well-calibrated (Brier score: 0.08)
- Latency: 120 ms per request

### 4.2 Subgroup Metrics
| Group     | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
|-----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Male      | 0.92     |   0.90    |  0.93  |
| Female    | 0.89     |   0.88    |  0.91  |
| Age <30   | 0.88     |   0.85    |  0.90  |
| Age 30-60 | 0.92     |   0.90    |  0.93  |

## 5. Fairness & Ethical Considerations
- Fairness Metrics:
  - Disparate Impact (Gender): 0.84 
  - Equal Opportunity Difference: 0.03 
- Known Biases / Limitations:
  - Slight underperformance for applicants <30 years old
  - ZIP code may act as a proxy for income/geography
- Mitigation Methods Used:
  - Pre-processing: Reweighting
  - In-processing: Fairness constraints
  - Post-processing: Threshold adjustment

## 6. Robustness & Security
- Stress tests: Simulated unusual applications → model robust
- Adversarial resilience: Basic tests applied
- Red-team: Manual review of outlier applications
- Vulnerable failure modes: Unknown/unseen feature combinations

## 7. Privacy & Safety
- PII present: Yes
- Anonymization: Masked SSN, tokenized names
- Access controls: Role-based access in data lake
- Regulatory compliance: DPDP Act (India), GDPR, SOC2

## 8. Intended Use & Misuse
- Intended Use: Assist loan officers in approval decisions
- Misuse / Out-of-Scope: Auto-approval without HITL, usage outside loan applications

## 9. Monitoring Plan
- Metrics tracked: Accuracy, PSI for drift, Fairness (DI & EOD)
- Retraining cadence: Quarterly or on drift alert
- HITL override rate monitored: max 10%
- Alert thresholds: PSI >0.2, DI <0.8

## 10. Model Lifecycle Status
- Status: Production
- Last Review Date: 01-Nov-2025
- Next Scheduled Review: 01-Feb-2026
